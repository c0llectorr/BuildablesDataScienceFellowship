**Hi Fellows,**

Here’s my today’s update.

**Date:** August 23, 2025
**Time Spent:** 2 hours

**Word of the Day:** Momentum – Once progress starts rolling, consistency turns small steps into unstoppable growth.

**Learning of the Day:**
Today I focused on strengthening my data manipulation, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis skills. I worked on practical exercises covering dataset handling, descriptive statistics, visualization, and modeling. This not only helped me reinforce fundamental concepts but also improved my ability to transition smoothly between raw data, feature exploration, and model building.
