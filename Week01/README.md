# My First Week at the Buildables Data Science Fellowship — Learning Python, OOP, DSA, and Data Science Tools

# **Introduction**
The first week of the Buildables Data Science Fellowship felt like the start of something meaningful. I was both nervous and excited — in a swirl of emotions — and ready to learn. Over five days, I met the team, solved programming tasks, dug into OOP and data structures, and took my first steps with data science libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

This post is a clear, honest account of that week: what I learned, how I felt, and the technical work I completed. I’ll also suggest visuals you can include to make this post more engaging on Medium.

# **Kickoff Meeting & Icebreaker**
Our fellowship began with an orientation meeting led by our team lead, Moneka. She laid out the program structure, expectations, and the roadmap for the coming weeks. We introduced ourselves and warmed up with an icebreaker game: “One Truth and One Lie.”

I still remember what I said: *“I’m a night owl and I can cook.”* Hira, one of my fellows, joked in the chat that *“making eggs and noodles does not count as cooking,”* and everyone laughed. That small moment made the environment feel instantly lighter and more human. The game helped me shake off nerves and connect with the group.

# **Days 2–3: Python Warm-up & Fundamentals**
The next two days were focused on coding fundamentals. Task 1 assigned basic programming problems in Python to build logical reasoning and get comfortable with Python syntax. Problems included tasks like implementing the Fibonacci sequence and checking palindromes.

Coming from a C++ background, I found Python much more concise and expressive. Solutions that often required more lines in C++ were short and readable in Python — a big confidence booster. I completed the tasks, uploaded them to my GitHub repo, and submitted on time.

**Task 2 and Task 3** introduced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). These exercises were challenging and rewarding — reinforcing concepts like:

# **Classes and objects**
Inheritance and encapsulation
Recursion and algorithmic complexity
Basic data structures (lists, stacks, queues)
These tasks sharpened my problem-solving approach and made me think about writing modular, testable code.

# **Day 4: Data Science Hands-On**
Task 4 was the most exciting part of the week — it focused on core data science work using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

# **What I did**
Loaded datasets (I used Iris, Breast Cancer, and California Housing from sklearn.datasets).
Read and created DataFrames from CSVs using pandas.read_csv().
Cleaned and manipulated data (inspected missing values, filtered rows, and created feature subsets).
Plotted bar graphs, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps to visualize feature relationships.
Trained a Linear Regression model using sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression and observed coefficients and intercepts.
Working with these datasets and tools made the abstractions in lectures feel real: data cleaning, feature selection, visualization, and building a baseline model.

# **Reading Assignment & Libraries**
Alongside practical tasks, we had a reading assignment to reinforce our understanding of the Python data stack. I refreshed and learned deeper details about:

**Pandas:** Data manipulation, DataFrame operations, groupby, merge, and pivot_table.
**NumPy:** Array operations, broadcasting, and vectorized computations.
**Matplotlib/Seaborn:** Plotting fundamentals and styling for clearer visualizations.
**Scikit-learn:** Estimators, fit/predict patterns, train_test_split, preprocessing, and evaluation metrics.
This reading helped me connect the dots between code and the mathematical or conceptual purpose behind each library.

# **The Community & Collaboration**
One of the most valuable parts of this week was the community. The fellows are collaborative, communicative, and supportive. Whenever I had questions or doubts — whether technical or about workflow — someone from the group usually had a helpful pointer. That kind of environment matters a lot when you’re learning fast.

# **Reflections & Next Steps**
If I had to sum the week in one word, it would be transformative. I moved from basic syntax warmups to running data analysis and training a model within days. The structure of the fellowship — the mix of reading, coding, and quick feedback loops — made the learning efficient.

**What I’m excited about next:** building more robust models, learning advanced preprocessing techniques, and working on a project that combines multiple datasets and visualizations.
