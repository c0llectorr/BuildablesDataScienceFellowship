**Hi Fellows,**

Here's my today's update.

**Date:** August 20, 2025.

**Time Spent:** 1 hour 

**Word of the Day:** *Refinement* â€“ Small improvements consistently applied can turn basic solutions into polished ones.

**Learning of the Day:** I continued solving tasks, focusing on exercises like palindrome sentences, anagrams, reversing words, temperature conversion, and creating a custom iterator. Working through these helped me strengthen my coding flow, understand reusable logic, and gain confidence in tackling diverse problems.
Other than these tasks I wrote a SIM_CLR model script for the research project for a Master's Student.
